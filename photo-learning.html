      <h2>How to Detect Fake Photos</h2>
      <p>Here are some techniques to help identify manipulated images:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Check the edges:</strong> Look for blurry or irregular edges around objects.</li>
        <li><strong>Examine shadows:</strong> Inconsistent shadow directions can reveal manipulation.</li>
        <li><strong>Look for pixelation:</strong> Areas that have been edited might show unusual pixel patterns.</li>
        <li><strong>Check metadata:</strong> Image metadata can sometimes reveal editing software used.</li>
        <li><strong>Reverse image search:</strong> Search for the image online to find original versions.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Remember, even professionals can be fooled by sophisticated manipulations!</p>

    <div id="ethics-info" class="info-section">
      <h2>Photo Ethics</h2>
      <p>Photo manipulation raises important ethical questions:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Journalism:</strong> News photos should never be manipulated in ways that change their meaning.</li>
        <li><strong>Advertising:</strong> Many countries have regulations about how much models can be digitally altered.</li>
        <li><strong>Social media:</strong> Filters and edits can create unrealistic beauty standards.</li>
        <li><strong>Historical photos:</strong> Altering historical images can distort our understanding of the past.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Always consider the context and potential impact before editing a photo.</p>
    </div>
    
    <div id="tools-info" class="info-section">
      <h2>Common Editing Tools</h2>
      <p>These are some of the most frequently used tools for photo manipulation:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Adobe Photoshop:</strong> The industry standard for professional image editing.</li>
        <li><strong>GIMP:</strong> A free and open-source alternative to Photoshop.</li>
        <li><strong>FaceApp:</strong> Specializes in facial transformations and aging effects.</li>
        <li><strong>Deepfake software:</strong> Uses AI to create realistic face swaps in videos.</li>
        <li><strong>Lightroom:</strong> Primarily for color correction but can be used for manipulation.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>While these tools can be used creatively, they can also be misused to deceive.</p>
    </div>
    
    <div id="history-info" class="info-section">
      <h2>History of Photo Manipulation</h2>
      <p>Photo manipulation is nearly as old as photography itself:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>1800s:</strong> Early photographers would combine multiple negatives to create "spirit photos."</li>
        <li><strong>1920s-30s:</strong> Stalin's regime famously altered photos to remove purged officials.</li>
        <li><strong>1980s:</strong> Digital editing began with the development of programs like Photoshop.</li>
        <li><strong>2000s:</strong> Social media made photo filters widely accessible to the public.</li>
        <li><strong>2010s-present:</strong> AI-powered tools made manipulation more sophisticated than ever.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Understanding this history helps us contextualize today's manipulated images.</p>
